Cupboard is the best app for both keeping track of your kitchen materials, as well as discovering amazing new recipes. It helps organize your kitchen, and plan ahead, so you can use your kitchen ingredients before they become outdated. 

Whether you're looking to explore exciting cuisine, manage what's in your refrigerator, or simply create a comprehensive grocery list, this amazing app has what you need.

### Recipes

The recipes section is full of many simple and beautiful recipes. Each one features step by step instructions on an elegant interface along with a visual ingredients section. Every recipe list item shows the user the number of available ingredients available, and needed to fully prepare the recipe.

### Cupboard

This trademark feature, is the one from which the app derives it's name. The cupboard section provides a place to add, remove, edit, or just view all available ingredients. The user can search for a specific ingredient in the tool bar, or view by ingredient category. 

### Cookbook

This is the place that all bookmarked recipes will appear. Simply click the bookmark icon in the upper left corner of a recipe in the Recipes section, and it's saved for late. The cookbook is where all your most favorite recipes can be read from anytime - regardless of 
a network connection.

### Groceries

Cupboard can help you create and organize a grocery list by letting you know what you'll need to make one of the featured recipes, and by providing an easy one click shopping cart add feature. When you've purchased the item simply add to your inventory directly from your grocery list.
